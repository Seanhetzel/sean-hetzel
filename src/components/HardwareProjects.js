Only problem is, I never got it to float.. But if we overlook that catastrophic failure that renders it totally useless, I think it turned out pretty well.",

Only problem was, halfway through making it, I realized there's no way to differentiate sending an on vs off single which meant it would constantly be turning on and off the TV whenever nobody was in the room.",
